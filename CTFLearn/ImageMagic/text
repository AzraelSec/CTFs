It looks like someone messed up my picture! Can anyone reorganize the pixels? The python module PIL (Python Imaging Library) might be useful! https://mega.nz/#!ys1VEKJJ!F11qnGJkXhH655YPc8ZKlbuGmMiS4Jg5Rsw2HI-AqNM Update: I think whoever messed up my image took every column of pixels and put them side by side. Update: I think the width of the image was 304 before they messed with it.
